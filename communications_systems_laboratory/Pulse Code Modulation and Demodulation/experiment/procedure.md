#### **Step by Step Procedure to perform Pulse Code Modulation experiment:**

##### **Step 1 :** The user should click on the theory under which the concept behind the working of the experiment would be displayed followed by the procedure on the screen. The user should perform the experiments based on the guidelines listed under the procedure.

#####  **Step 2 :** The required blocks are statically positioned. Click on any one connection point to initiate the wire connection and click on another connection point to complete the connection. Clicking on any part of the simulation canvas after initiating a wire will cause the wire to be anchored to that point. Connect all the blocks in the right order.
