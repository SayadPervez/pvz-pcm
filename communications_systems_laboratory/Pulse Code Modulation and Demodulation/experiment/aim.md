###  **Aim:**
##### To study and understand the process of Pulse Code Modulation and Demodulation scheme and calculate the transmission bandwidth, signaling rate, step size and signal to quantization noise ratio (SQNR) for the same using the Virtual Labs Assessment Tool (V.L.A.T).


##### The user would be able to perform Pulse Code Modulation and Demodulation and evaluate the performance of the PCM system based on the transmission bandwidth, signaling rate, step size and signal to quantization noise ratio (SQNR).
