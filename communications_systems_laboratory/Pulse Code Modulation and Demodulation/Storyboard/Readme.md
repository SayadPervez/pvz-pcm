#### Proposal ID : NITK_PALS_22_017_05

#### Experiment Name : ***Pulse Code Modulation and Demodulation***


#### Story Outline:
##### **Pulse code modulation (PCM) is a type of analog to digital (A/D) conversion technique in which the input analog signal is sampled at regular intervals and the information in each sample is represented in digital form. The goal of this experiment is to understand the basic principle of pulse code modulation (PCM) and demodulation and how well the analog signal at the transmitter is converted into n-bit binary (digital) using a sampler, quantizer and encoder. Sampling is the process of converting continuous time signals into discrete time signals. The continuous amplitude signal is converted into discrete amplitude signal by means of quantizer and the signal discrete in both time and amplitude into digital using encoder. The baseband signal at the receiver is retrieved from the encoded binary data by using decoder and reconstruction filter. The required transmission bandwidth, signaling rate, step size and signal to quantization noise ratio (SQNR) are examined to evaluate the performance of the PCM system.**

#### Story:

##### **The simulator workspace comprises the blocks such as sine wave generator, sampler, quantizer, encoder, decoder, reconstruction filter and evaluate block. The position of the blocks are static and wires are to be connected by the user as per the block diagram to perform pulse code modulation and demodulation. The user has to set the amplitude and frequency parameters of input blocks to perform the simulation and view the output of pulse code modulation and demodulation. The parameters such as Transmission Bandwidth, step size, signaling rate and signal to quantization noise ratio can be observed using the ‚ÄúEvaluate‚Äù block.**
