#### Proposal ID : **NITK_PALS21_037**

#### Experiment Name : ***Amplitude Modulation and Demodulation***


#### Story Outline:
##### **This experiment focuses on understanding the principle of amplitude modulation & demodulation.  This experiment is formulated to study the performance of various types of amplitude modulation schemes (DSB-FC, DSB-SC & SSB) for different modulation index and also its impact on modulated signal can be analyzed. Furthermore, the  modulation index, efficacy and the   total transmitted power for each category of the amplitude modulation can be estimated and verified.**

#### Story:

##### **The simulator workspace comprises blocks that the end user may drag and drop into the workspace according to a predefined procedure. Amplitude modulation may be done in three ways: DSB-FC, DSB-SC, and SSB-SC. The user can start with the block connections based on the type of modulation he or she prefers. When selecting the sine wave generator block, the end user may input their preferred values for the attributes (fixed amplitude, frequency, etc.) in the corresponding fields (Amplitude, Frequency).While performing each subcategory of amplitude modulation, the user may observe the power and modulation index for each subcategory by clicking on the relevant modulation/demodulation blocks. The modulation index can also be classified as over , under, or critical modulation by the simulator. For demodulation, under each category, demodulation blocks are made available and may be dragged & dropped in the workspace by the user , and the connections are established  based on the instructions mentioned in the  procedure ,so as to extract the message signal from the modulated signal of the category. The simulator also calculates the efficacy of amplitude modulation/demodulation under each subcategory using the original message signal and the message signal extracted from the modulated signal.**



#### Set User Objectives & Goals:

##### **1) Understand the principle of amplitude modulation (AM) and demodulation.**
##### **2) Select the type of sinusoidal signal to be used as modulating and carrier signal.**
##### **3) Recall the conditions for perfect modulation and choose the amplitude and frequency of the modulating and carrier signal by satisfying the conditions (fc>>fm and Ac >>Am).**
##### **4) Calculate the modulation index (mu) and check whether under modulation condition is satisfied for   perfect recovery of signal at the receiver end.**
##### **5) Analyze the AM modulation for different modulation indices (mu=1, mu>1 & mu<1).**
##### **6) Analyze the types of AM such as DSB-FC, DSB-SC and SSB-SC in time  domain.**  
##### **7) Calculate the total power consumption and efficiency for all the types of amplitude modulation scheme for performance comparison.**

#### Pathway activities:


##### **1) The students will have to browse through the theory and procedure by navigating to theory icon and clicking on it, so as  to guide the student in  performing the process of simulating amplitude modulation & demodulation with ease.**
##### **2) The students should then choose  an appropriate value as the input signal frequency so that the input signal modulates the carrier signal with proper amplitude and frequency values.**
##### **3) The students would then compute the modulation index manually for the specified inputs manually and compare the same with the simulation generated modulation index (purely for improving conceptual clarity in the topic).**
##### **4) The students would then  be  given the liberty to choose the type of modulation based on the layout diagram prescribed for the type and record the output for the same.**

##### **5)The students should then calculate the power values for all the types of modulation and find the efficiency and conclude the best modulation technique based on the computed values(manually& compare the same with the simulation generated values) for the same.**
