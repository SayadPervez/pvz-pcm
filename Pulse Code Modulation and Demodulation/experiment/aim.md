###  **Aim:**
##### To study and understand the process of Amplitude Modulation/Demodulation scheme and calculate the power, modulation index for the same using the Virtual Labs Assessment Tool (V.L.A.T).


##### The user would be able to perform amplitude Modulation/Demodulation and classify the best modulation scheme( among the types: Single Side Band (SSB),Double Sideband with Full Carrier (DSB-FC) and Double Sideband with Suppressed Carrier (DSB-SC) ) based on total power, efficiency and modulation index
